# PeTinder

### Like Tinder, but for pet adoption

This small web app allows users to look at one random dog or cat at a time, and 'swipe' by clicking next to see the next available pet for adoption.

Built with React and Tailwind.

### To get started:

- cd into the directory for your project.

        npx create-react-app YOUR_PROJECT_NAME

- git clone this repo into your project directory.

        npm install
